I’m Tu Li, a third-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Arizona. Before starting my doctoral studies, I earned a master’s degree in Pure Mathematics from California State University, Long Beach, and a bachelor’s degree in Economics from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. My research interests broadly include theoretical econometrics and high-dimensional statistics.
